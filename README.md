# roomba_wifi_map
Map your wifi signal strength with your Roomba!

Only works on linux for some stupid reason :P

Requires nmap:
sudo apt install nmap

Run:
python roomba_wifi_map.py

Once you get all the right credentials it will begin listening for messages from your roomba and will record signal strength and location to a csv file.

Will be adding plotting functionality soon.
